                        <h3>Identify in Christ</h3>
                        <p> Christ often emphasize the belief that individuals find their truest sense of self purpose through their relationship with Christ. 

Identity as a child of God: Christians believe that through faith in Jesus, they become children of God, adopted into His family. This understanding shapes their sense of identity, knowing they are loved and valued by God. 

New creation: The Bible teaches that those who are in Christ are new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), with old things passed away and all things made new. This emphasizes the transformative power of Christ in shaping one's identity. 

Purpose and calling:
Identity in Christ often includes a sense purpose and calling. 
Christians believe that are created for good works (Ephesians 2:10) and called to serve and glorify God in all aspects of their lives. 
Christians are taught that they have an inheritance in Christ (Ephesians 1:11) and are co-heirs with Him (Romans 8:17). This understanding of shared inheritance emphasizes their identity as part of the spiritual family of believers. 

Overall teaching about identity in Christ emphasize a deep, personal relationship with Jesus as the foundation for understanding one's true identity, purpose, and worth

                        <h3>IDENTIFY IN CHRIST</h3>
                        <p>

You can look for your identity anywhere, but followers of Jesus are called to find their identity in Him.
 t is important, as you define your identity, that God not be just an aspect of who you are, like ‚ÄúI am a Christian,‚Äù or ‚ÄùI am religious,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am spiritual‚Äù.  Understanding your identity in God starts with understanding who He is, what He says about Himself, and what He says about you. Your identity can be defined by who God is making you to be in His image. 
 What the Bible Says About Identity in Christ 

God wants you to find out for yourself by reading His Word. Your identity should never be based on a hope or a guess. God gave us His Word, the Bible, so you can know Him and know who He is making you to be in Him.

‚ÄúYou are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God‚Äôs people and also members of his household.‚Äù (Ephesians 2:19, New International Version)

We are members of His household, not strangers. If you follow Christ, you belong in God‚Äôs household and with His people.

In this passage, Paul is encouraging followers of Christ to remember that they are all part of one family. They are to be unified with each other.  This can only happen if you understand that you are a legitimate child of God. You are part of His family.  
 
‚ÄúSee what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know Him.‚Äù (1 John 3:1, NIV)

In Christ, you are loved. Your identity is a child of God. This Bible verse comes from a chapter that warns against the temptation to stray from God into sin. You can resist sin by remembering that God has the best for His children. He offers you more than the world ever could. You are complete in His love.
 

‚ÄúThe LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in His love He will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.‚Äù (Zephaniah 3:17, NIV)

Jesus delights in you. You are not just accepted or put up with. You are welcomed into His family with delight.

‚ÄúGod made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.‚Äù (2 Corinthians 5:21, NIV)

You are God‚Äôs righteousness. You are His goodness and rightness because of what Christ did on the cross. This was given to you, and you are called righteous by the Lord of the universe.

‚ÄúIf anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!‚Äù (2 Corinthians 5:17, NIV)
In Christ, you are a new creation. God has made you new. The old things that used to define you have been taken away. 
You are new because through Jesus your sin has been paid for. You have been restored in right standing before God. 
 
‚ÄúYou are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God‚Äôs special possession, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.‚Äù (1 Peter 2:9, NIV)

 By faith in Jesus through the power of the Holy Spirit, if you trust in Jesus, you are part of His holy, chosen people.

 Blessed week brethren üôè.

                        MCK Kunene  Church  is one  of a  kind  .Through  it, I  grew  vocaly  I  remember  days  
                        when  I  couldn't  sing  high  keys  because  I was  afraid I  will  ruin .  I can  also  
                        say  in it  I  found   friends  who  are  open  with  each  other  which  made  me  at  
                        ease  ‚ò∫Ô∏è  I'm  glad  that  my  relationship  with  God  is  also  growing   I  haven't  
                        reached  what  I've been  aiming  at  though. I remember  I  once  read  a post  somewhere   
                        and  it  said"many found  a place  in church but  not  their  position  in  Christ ".which  
                        taught me  that  you  could  be  in  church  but  you're not  growing  in  anyway.

                        <h3>God's love</h3>
                        <p>
                        God's love is beautifully portrayed throughout the Bible, revealing His unconditional care and 
                        compassion for humanity. In John 3:16, it's written, "For God so loved the world that he gave 
                        his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
                        " This verse epitomizes the depth of God's love, demonstrating His willingness to sacrifice 
                        for our salvation.
                        Romans 5:8 "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, 
                        Christ died for us." Here, we see that God's love is not dependent on our actions or merit; 
                        it's freely given, despite our flaws and shortcomings.
                        1 John 4:9-10 affirms, "This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only 
                        Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but 
                        that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins." God's love is an 
                        active force that seeks our well-being, leading to reconciliation and eternal life through 
                        Jesus Christ.

                        children. Junior church activities  include Bible stories, songs, crafts, and interactive lessons 
                        aimed at nurturing children's faith and understanding of Christian teachings. We have a whole library
                        for kids to read Bible in various stories and Bible quizzes that enrich kids with knowledge about God

                        <p>Our church is  driven and purposed church that recognizes the necessity of prayer and dependence on 
                            God's guidance, wisdom and power. Our church seeks God's direction in decision-making, 
                            intercedes for the needs of its members and community, and acknowledges that truly transformation

                        <p>I AM WITH YOU, says the Lord. These four words are like a safety net, protecting you from 
                            falling into despair. Because you are human, you will always have ups and downs in your life 
                            experience. But the promise of His presence LIMITS HOW FAR DOWN YOU CAN GO. Sometimes you 
                            may feel as if you are in a free fall, when people or things you had counted on let you 
                            down. Yet as soon as you remember that God is with you, your perspective changes radically. 
                            Instead of bemoaning your circumstances, you can look to Him for help. He will hold by His 
                            hand and guide you with His counsel.
